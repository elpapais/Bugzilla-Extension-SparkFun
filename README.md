SparkFun's Bugzilla Extension
-----------------------------

At the moment, this just does a little bit of custom auto-linking on our
in-house Bugzilla installation. To the best of my recollection, it's a
variation on a sample extension I found in the Bugzilla distribution.

There's little reason you'd want to use this, but it may serve someone as a
useful example.
